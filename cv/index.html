<h2>INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p>Shell, Houston, TX, Summer 2015
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applied geophysics background and software development skills in C++ to build and deploy a wavelet spectra analysis tool with advanced functionality.

<p>Shell, Houston, TX, Summer 2014
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created a database organizing Shell applications for subsurface exploration and well analysis. This database increases efficiency of software development teams by consolidating previously scattered application information and making it readily available for future collaboration.
